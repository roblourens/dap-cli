# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-06)

**Core value:** Agents can reliably control a DAP debug session from repeatable CLI commands and inspect paused application state without needing language-specific debugger knowledge.
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — external project hardening expansion complete

## Current Position

Phase: 08 (external-project-hardening-expansion)
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Complete — external repo expansion executed and Phase 8 gaps closed
Last activity: 2026-05-08 -- closed GAP-08-01 through GAP-08-03

Progress: [█████████░] 99%

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 05.1 inserted after Phase 05: A mode for the CLI where it produces human-readable nicely formatted output instead of JSON. (URGENT)
- Phase 07 completed: Hardening bug discovery and exploratory smoke testing.
- Phase 08 complete: External project hardening expansion closed GAP-08-01 through GAP-08-03.

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Establish the persistent controller, language-neutral DAP core, polling/event cache, JSON contracts, and fake-adapter tests before real adapters.
- [Phase 2]: Generate the full typed DAP request command surface from official protocol metadata rather than maintaining it by hand.
- [Phase 3]: Treat built-in and custom adapters as external services resolved through descriptors, config, processes, and transports.
- [Phase 4]: Finish v1 with README/user docs, Playwright interop examples, self-hosting, smoke coverage, and agentic exploratory verification.

### Pending Todos

- Pick the next milestone item or revisit deferred Phase 5.2 launch.json compound execution.

### Blockers/Concerns

## Quick Tasks Completed

| ID | Slug | Date | Summary |
|----|------|------|---------|
| 260504-rp5 | reverse-duplicate-name-session-disambigu | 2026-05-04 | Reject duplicate `--name` at session create time (`session_name_in_use`); resolver prefers live records over terminated when matching by name. Reverses earlier `session_ambiguous` design. |
