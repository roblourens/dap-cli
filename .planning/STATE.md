# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-06)

**Core value:** Agents can reliably control a DAP debug session from repeatable CLI commands and inspect paused application state without needing language-specific debugger knowledge.
**Current focus:** Phase 07 complete — hardening bug discovery and exploratory smoke testing

## Current Position

Phase: 07 (hardening-bug-discovery-and-exploratory-smoke-testing)
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Complete — discovery, gap closure, final full test suite, and hand-driven smoke passed
Last activity: 2026-05-08 -- completed Phase 7 hardening discovery and exploratory smoke testing

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 05.1 inserted after Phase 05: A mode for the CLI where it produces human-readable nicely formatted output instead of JSON. (URGENT)
- Phase 07 completed: Hardening bug discovery and exploratory smoke testing.

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Establish the persistent controller, language-neutral DAP core, polling/event cache, JSON contracts, and fake-adapter tests before real adapters.
- [Phase 2]: Generate the full typed DAP request command surface from official protocol metadata rather than maintaining it by hand.
- [Phase 3]: Treat built-in and custom adapters as external services resolved through descriptors, config, processes, and transports.
- [Phase 4]: Finish v1 with README/user docs, Playwright interop examples, self-hosting, smoke coverage, and agentic exploratory verification.

### Pending Todos
